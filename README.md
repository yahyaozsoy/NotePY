# NotePy
This is another type of *Notepad but With Python* thing 

## Why you made that?
I don't know, I was just bored  

## How can I use it?
After downloading [projectÂ²](https://github.com/yahyaozsoy/3Xplus1#links) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)(you can use every version which is 3.6 and above), you should just **simply cilck *NotePY.pyw*** and it will **automatically** generate **necessary things** for you.
When it closed you can click to the **.txt** file which is located in logs folder, to see the log.

***Note:** If it doesn't start, you should open your Command Prompt and write `pip install numpy` and `pip install matplotlib` with that you can freely open the file.*
