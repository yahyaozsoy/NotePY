# NotePy
This is another type of *"Notepad but With Python"* thing 

## Why you made that?
I don't know, I was just bored  

## How can I use it?
After downloading [projectÂ¹](https://github.com/yahyaozsoy/3Xplus1#links) and [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)(you can use every version which is 3.6 and above), you should just **simply cilck *NotePY.pyw*** and it will **automatically** generate **necessary things** for you.
If you think there is a **problem** please report me

***Note:** If it doesn't work, you should open your *Command Prompt* and write `pip install tkinter` and `pip install textblob` with that you can freely open the file.*
